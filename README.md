🧠 Logistic Regression Classification - Breast Cancer Detection
📌 Objective
Build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

📂 Dataset
Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset on Kaggle

Contains features computed from digitized images of a breast mass (mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.)

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas – data manipulation

Matplotlib – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning model and evaluation

✅ Steps Performed
Loaded and explored the dataset

Preprocessed the data:

Dropped irrelevant columns

Converted categorical labels (M, B) to binary (1, 0)

Split into training and test sets

Standardized the features

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated the model using:

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

ROC-AUC Score & ROC Curve

Visualized the Sigmoid Function to understand how logistic regression works

📊 Results
High Accuracy in classifying malignant vs benign tumors

ROC-AUC score showed excellent separability

Sigmoid curve illustrated probability estimation from raw scores

📷 Screenshots (if any)
Include plots of:

ROC Curve

Confusion Matrix

Sigmoid function (optional)

📁 Files Included
